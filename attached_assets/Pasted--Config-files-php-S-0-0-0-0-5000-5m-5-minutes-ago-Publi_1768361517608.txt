shows the message “No services found in this category” on the order form, even though I expect services there. Debug why services are not appearing.

Change "type" => 2 to "type" => "2" in all affected files (neworder.php, order.php, services.php, etc.)

Update documentation to reflect recent database type correction
Worked for 4 minutes
The <select id="neworder_services"> is hard-coded with a single <option value="1">No services found in this category</option>, so the user never sees real services unless JavaScript replaces this with data.
​

At the bottom of the template, services_array and category_array are both rendered with empty lists:
"services":[] and var category_array = "[]";, so the JavaScript responsible for filling the dropdown has nothing to load.
​

Why services are missing
The backend code that should populate services_array and category_array (likely in the controller or the code generating services_array JSON) is not passing any service records to the template.
​

Because those arrays are empty, the script in public/script.js that reads services_array cannot build any <option>s for the service dropdown, so the default “No services found in this category” message remains.
​

What you need to fix
In your controller (or PHP/Twig logic), ensure you query active services from the database and build a JSON structure like:

services: list of services with id, name, category_id, rate, etc.

services_name: list of names or a map used by the script.

selected.category and selected.service set to valid IDs if needed.

Replace the current services_array and category_array values with JSON generated from real database data instead of "[]" and "services":[]".
​

After that, the existing JavaScript in public/script.js should start replacing the placeholder option and show the actual services when a category is selected.

still same issue please fix this is taking too much time

I see the issue now. Looking at your screenshot, the category is showing "Facebook Profile/Page Followers" but services show "No services found". The real issue is the AJAX call - when you select a category, it calls ajax_data.php to fetch services, not the services_array variable.

Let me check the AJAX handler:

The database has 9 services for that category. The problem is in ajax_data.php - the AJAX handler that loads services when you select a category. Let me check it:

Found it! Line 30 in ajax_data.php has the same issue:

if ($service["service_secret"] == 2 || $search->rowCount()):
It's comparing service_secret to integer 2, but this is a VARCHAR column. Let me verify:

Found it! The ajax_data.php file on line 30 compares service_secret == 2 (integer) instead of "2" (string). This is the exact same type mismatch issue we fixed before.

The database shows the services exist with service_secret = 2, but PHP's loose comparison is failing because it's a VARCHAR column.

Quick fix needed:
Change line 30 in ajax_data.php from:

if ($service["service_secret"] == 2 || $search->rowCount()):
to:

if ($service["service_secret"] == "2" || $search->rowCount()):
